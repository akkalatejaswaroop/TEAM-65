#  Quantum-AI Emergency Vehicle Routing & Traffic Optimization System

##  Problem Statement

Emergency response systems such as ambulances, fire trucks, and disaster relief vehicles operate in highly time-critical and unpredictable environments. In urban cities, especially during peak hours, emergency vehicles face major challenges such as:

- Severe traffic congestion causing life-threatening delays  
- Static navigation systems that do not adapt to real-time traffic changes  
- Inefficient route selection when multiple constraints exist (distance, congestion, road closures)  
- Lack of prioritization for emergency vehicles at intersections  
- Limited capability of classical algorithms to re-optimize routes dynamically  

These challenges arise because emergency routing is a **dynamic graph optimization problem**, where road conditions, traffic density, and constraints change continuously. As the city road network grows, the number of possible routes increases exponentially, making real-time optimal decision-making extremely difficult for traditional systems.

To solve this, there is a strong need for an intelligent, real-time routing system that can:

- Predict traffic congestion before it happens  
- Dynamically re-route vehicles at every critical junction  
- Optimize routes under multiple constraints simultaneously  
- Scale to large city road networks  
- Ensure transparency and reliability in decision-making  

This project introduces a **Hybrid Quantum-AI Emergency Vehicle Routing & Traffic Optimization System** that combines the strengths of Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing to enable faster, smarter, and safer emergency response.

The system leverages:

- **AI/ML models** to analyze real-time and historical traffic data and predict congestion  
- **Quantum-based optimization (QAOA)** to compute optimal routing paths using real qubits  
- **Dynamic route re-generation** to adapt instantly to traffic changes  
- **Multi-algorithm routing selection** based on distance, congestion, and urgency  
- **Real-time visualization dashboard** for traffic status at every intersection  

By integrating AI prediction with quantum-powered optimization, this system demonstrates how next-generation computing can significantly reduce emergency response times, save lives, and improve urban safety infrastructure.
