# 🚆 Quantum‑AI Railway Scheduling & Collision Avoidance System

## 📌 Problem Statement

Railway transportation systems operate under highly complex and dynamic conditions where thousands of trains share limited track and platform infrastructure. As traffic density increases, traditional rule‑based scheduling systems struggle to prevent:

- Delays caused by congestion, bottlenecks, and cascading timing conflicts  
- Inefficient platform allocation leading to station overcrowding  
- Routing conflicts where two or more trains attempt to use the same track segment  
- Rare but high‑risk collisions at multi‑route intersections  

These challenges arise because train scheduling is a **combinatorial optimization problem**, where the number of possible valid schedules grows exponentially with the number of trains. Existing systems lack the capability to compute optimal or near‑optimal solutions in real time.

To address this, there is a need for an intelligent decision-support system that can:

- Predict congestion and delays  
- Optimize train sequencing and platform allocation  
- Ensure collision‑free routing  
- Provide transparent reasoning for operational decisions  

This project introduces a **Hybrid Quantum‑AI Railway Scheduling & Collision Avoidance System** that leverages:

- **AI/ML models** for delay and congestion prediction  
- **Quantum-inspired optimization** for schedule generation  
- **Automated conflict detection** for safety assurance  
- **Explainable AI** to justify scheduling decisions
